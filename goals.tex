Successful students are able to:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item[1.1.] Use logical, mathematical and/or statistical concepts and methods
    to
    represent real-world situations.

    technologies and tools to communicate about data symbolically, visually,
    numerically and verbally.
  \item[1.3.] Draw appropriate inferences from data based on quantitative
    analysis
    and/or
    logical reasoning.
  \item[1.4.] Make and evaluate important assumptions in estimation, modeling,
    and
    logical argumentation and/or data analysis.

    quantitative
    reasoning.
